# Solution

The flag was typed on a US/EU keyboard but the OS layout was set to Spanish Dvorak.

The text description can reveal that the layout is Dvorak and the `ñ` character should hint that it is Spanish.

The goal is to find the layout of this keyboard online or via OS and remap the keys to the US/EU keyboard to get the flag:

```
